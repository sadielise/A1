CS414 A1 Overview

Overall, I was able to follow the test-driven development approach for
this assignment. I tried to start by testing the Company class, but found
that not having tested or built the other classes first made that challenging
since Company heavily depends on the rest of the classes. So, I tested then 
implemented the classes in the following order: Qualification, Project,
Worker, and Company. This allowed me to get an in-depth understanding of how
each class worked and how the classes interacted.
